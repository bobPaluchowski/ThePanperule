# ThePanperule

## Description
This is my hobby project for managing my knowledge. It's a electron app with vanilla javascript on the frontend, and probably Mysql locally for a backend. The knowledge will be managed by locally run LLM. Additionally the whole thing will be contenerized with Docker for better user experience.
